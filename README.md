## Features

- Comprehensive feature engineering pipeline
- Stacking ensemble model combining multiple regressors
- Detailed visualization and analysis tools
- Model performance evaluation

## Usage

1. Data Exploration:
   - See `notebooks/1_EDA.ipynb` for detailed exploratory data analysis

2. Model Training:
```python
from src.model import YieldPredictor
from src.feature_engineering import feature_engineering

# Prepare data
X_processed = feature_engineering(X)

# Train model
model = YieldPredictor()
model.fit(X_processed, y)
```

3. Make Predictions:
```python
predictions = model.predict(X_test_processed)
```

## Model Performance

- Training MAE: X.XX
- Validation MAE: X.XX
- Test MAE: X.XX

## Visualizations

The `src/visualization.py` module provides various plotting functions:
- Feature importance
- Learning curves
- Predictions vs actual values
- Residual analysis
